1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

THis creates the .git directory which tells git that this directory contains a repository.  This does not add any files to the repository, but preps the repository for files to be added to it.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the changes to the working directory that will be committed to the repository.  It provides an intermediate area that gives the user the ability to re-check that they are committing the files they want to and not committing those that they do not want to commit.
